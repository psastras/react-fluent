# Hero

A hero highlights important content as well as the primary action on a page. Usually used at the top of the page, immediately after the header. A hero always extends across the entire content area and may feature important navigation elements via buttons.

## Examples

```javascipt
<Hero size="small" shadow>
    <Title>Product Feature</Title>
    <Title level="h2">Feature subtitle</Title>
</Hero>
```

```javascipt
<Hero size="med" imageUrl="/assets/images/hero2.jpg">
    <Title>Product Feature</Title>
    <Title level="h2">Feature subtitle</Title>
</Hero>
```

## Usage

The hero element automatically vertically centers and left aligns any elements inside it. Use with the `<Title>` component to add large text. Use with the `<Button>` component to add actions to the Hero.
