# Button

The button component renders a styled native html button element.

## Examples

```javascript
<Button>Continue</Button>
```

## Usage

Select components are mostly commonly used in forms and dialogs to provide the user with a set of actions. Buttons may also be used to emphasize a navigational item (in lieu of a standard anchor).
