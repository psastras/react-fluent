# Navigation

The navigation component is a horizontal set of links which collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile devices.

## Examples

```javascript
<Navigation>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">Docs</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
</Navigation>
```

## Usage

Use the navigation component as the main navigational component of a page. Combine with the Page Bar component to provide a set of links on the page header. Combine with the Side Navigation component to provide more detailed page links.
