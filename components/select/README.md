# Select

The select component renders a styled native html `<select>` element. The component presents the user with a list of options to choose from.

## Examples

```javascript
<Select>
  <span>Option 1</span>
  <span>Option 2</span>
</Select>
```

## Usage

Select components are mostly commonly used in forms where there are a limited number of options to choose from. The select component may also be used as alternative collapsed navigation menu for limited width devices.

## Options
