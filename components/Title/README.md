# Title

The title component is used to display headings within the page. It makes each of the heading types (`h1, h2`) available as well as each of their corresponding styles.

## Examples

```javascipt
<Title level="h1" type="subheading">The fox jumped over the lazy dog.</Title>
```

```javascipt
<Title level="h3">The fox jumped over the lazy dog.</Title>
```

## Usage

Be aware of page structure when using the title components. A web page should only have one `<h1>` component. The `type` parameter allows for customization of the typeface for the specified heading level if necessary (for example giving an `h2` level heading an `h1` style).
